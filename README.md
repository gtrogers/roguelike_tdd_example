## Roguelike with TDD

This code is based on [this tutorial from the RogueBasin site](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python3%2Btdl,_part_1). As I go through the tutorial I'm refactoring the code and adding feature and unit tests.

## Running the tests

The feature tests can be run with behave `behave ./tests/feature`

The unit tests can be run with nose `python3 -m nose ./tests/unit`

## Getting set up

You will need python3 and pip. Everything else can be installed with `python3 -m pip -r requirements.txt` and `python3 -m pip -r requirements.dev.txt`
